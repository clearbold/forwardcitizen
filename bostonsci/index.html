<p>Hello, Boston Scientific!</p>

<p>Mark Reeves &amp; Aaron Taylor-Waldman are a branding and digital design &amp; development team collaborating under the name Forward Citizen. (We&rsquo;d started off as <a target="_blank" href="http://essentialco.com">Essential Design Collective</a> before realizing that another firm had already been using that and are working on building out our brand, website, and joint portfolio.) Contracts are routed through Mark&rsquo;s Clearbold, LLC, which maintains E&amp;O insurance and has been in business for 9+&nbsp;years.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a bit about&nbsp;us:</p>

<ul>

    <li><a target="_blank" href="http://taylorwaldman.com/index/">Feast your eyes on Aaron&rsquo;s branding &amp; design&nbsp;portfolio</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>We recently designed and coded a new website for <a target="_blank" href="http://boardpackager.com">BoardPackager</a>, including a palette of custom icons, and are working with SavingStar to refresh and optimize their Welcome email series, including custom icons and imagery. 2016 has also had us consulting on technology and creating a brand for <a target="_blank" href="http://www.tickproject.org/">The Tick Project</a>, creating a brand for Hofstra&rsquo;s <a target="_blank" href="http://hofstradrc.org">Digital Research Center</a>, and designing and building websites for the George Sand Association and <a target="_blank" href="http://amp.hofstradrc.org">AMP&nbsp;Magazine</a>.</p>

<p><strong>What can we help&nbsp;with?</strong></p>

<p>Call on Mark &amp; Aaron&nbsp;for:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Development or design+development of campaign, product/service line, or event-driven responsive landing pages and&nbsp;microsites...</li>
    <li>Responsive HTML email templates or single&nbsp;campaigns...</li>
    <li>Data visualization microsites or&nbsp;pages...</li>
    <li>Icon sets that reinforce those efforts and are true to the&nbsp;brand...</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Thanks for checking out our work!</strong> We look forward to working&nbsp;together.</p>

<p>â€“ Aaron &amp; Mark</p>
