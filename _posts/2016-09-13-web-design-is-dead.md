title: Web Design Is Dead

A hypothetical client asks:

> I need a new website, but all I see are people selling UX Design. What happened to web design?

Web design is dead. Mobile design is just web design now and that’s not a specific thing, either.

UX Design, or User Experience Design, is a somewhat condescending and general, but also more accurate, term. It’s something of a pejorative to call the people who interact with the things we design mere users, but the label has stuck.

We say User Experience Design because customers interact with, or experience, your business or organization’s brand across a wide array of touchpoints: Your website on screens large and small, social media, by email or phone, in person. Those interactions and the data they produce are tracked, and that data is used to personalize the experience across those channels. Just designing a website falls short if it doesn’t take all that into account and fit into that bigger picture.

That doesn’t mean that a UX Design team can’t design your website. It means that designing your website is a subset of a bigger brand effort, no matter the size of your business. It means that a website designed as a set of specifically designed pages that assume content won’t change over time is likely a wasted effort. Just as UX Design addresses a system of customer interactions and business functions, a website design should produce a system of layout and content components that can be updated, expanded, mixed and, moved around to support multiple use cases.
