The future of design, marketing, and technology services for clients is **Digital&nbsp;Brand&nbsp;Support**.

Your brand is more than your logo. It encompasses every bit of value your organization demonstrates. Some of that is intertwined with technology. Some of it consists of purposefully designed elements. Customers and community members interact with your brand on the web, in apps, on social media, through email, and via customer support or in-person&nbsp;interactions.

Gone are the days when we could advocate one single best approach or platform and design &amp; build for that. You have technology already in place or embedded in your industry and people coming at you through channels they&rsquo;re most comfortable in. Your brand needs a flexible website that can grow and evolve, content management tools, marketing email templates designed and coded for delivery, a logo and collateral kit, a style guide, a voice &amp; tone guide, or platform integration to move customer data from one system to another. You need a partner who supports any and all of that, and understands how those pieces fit&nbsp;together.

Digital Brand Support is agnostic in approach and deliberate in strategy. It&rsquo;s not a question of possessing a particular skill. It&rsquo;s a matter of understanding the four pillars of digital&nbsp;branding:

* The **content** people are asking for or you&rsquo;re trying to&nbsp;convey.
* A **consistent** experience across all of your brand&rsquo;s channels&mdash;and within each channel, choosing utility over novelty to reduce friction in completing a&nbsp;task.
* Transforming the **constraints** of digital channels&mdash;whether screen size, bandwidth, or device capabilities&mdash;into creative&nbsp;opportunities.
* Understanding **context** to support individuals from different socioeconomic backgrounds, lifestyles, or times of day and&nbsp;locations.

No job is too big, too small, or outside of our skillset in Digital Brand Support. Our job is to look at where we can bolster brand value across the four pillars, whether through pixels, process, or code. How we get the job done will continue to evolve over time. The what & the why of the job will remain constant. Through one-off projects or across a long-term relationship, that support is what we provide to&nbsp;you.
